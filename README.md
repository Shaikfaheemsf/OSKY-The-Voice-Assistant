Osky, the voice assistant, is developed using Python, a language well-suited for both scripting and development tasks. This script aims to create a versatile voice assistant that can adapt to users' queries. Utilizing Python's SpeechRecognition API, audio input is converted into text, a fundamental process employed in popular voice assistants like Alexa and Siri. To accomplish this, several Python packages are essential, including SpeechRecognition, Datetime, pyttsx3, wikipedia, Web Browser, smtplib, PyJokes, pyautogui, translate, and the WOlFRAME API. Additionally, resolving potential PyAudio errors involves installing PyWin, then manually installing PyAudio from a specified website or using the pipwin tool. This comprehensive approach enables the creation of a robust voice assistant capable of handling diverse tasks efficiently.
